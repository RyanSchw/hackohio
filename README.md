We aim to analyze the amount of "vine energy" new tik tok videos have. We complete this by using transfer learning to train a RNN classifier that classifies the amount of "vine energy" a sentence has. We leveraged Microsoft's cognitive services to convert an input video's speech to text for analysis. In addition, it also takes the sentiment of the tik tok (using Text Analytics) to analyze the difference sentiment. also lol
